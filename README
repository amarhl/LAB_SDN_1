# LAB 5 Python Function
# Print Functions - For the first section we will simple create a function that does not accept an argument but prints a 
# message to the screen. Write a print functions that do not require arguments that prints a message to the screen. 
# Include  a screenshot of your code and the output of the function. 
def first_function():
	print("This is my first function without arguments")
#first_message() # type this in to get the Global
def second_function():
	print("This is my second function without arguments")
#second_message() # type this in to get the global


# Lab 5 Simple Functions with Single Arguments
# For this section we will demonstrate the use of a function with a single argument. Create two functions that print a 
# message to the terminal along with the value of the argument. Create a variable per function for a total of two variables 
# and pass them into the function. 

headphone01 = "sennheiser"
headphone02 = "hifiman"
def my_headphone(hiFidelity):
	print("My favorite headphone is " + hiFidelity)
# my_headphone(headphone01) # type this in
def my_headphone(hiFidelity):
	print("My favorite headphone is " + hiFedelity)
# my_headphone(headphone02) # type this in


# Lab 5 Ordered Arguments
# In this section we are going to create two functions that accepts more than one argument as ordered arguments. Create
# two separate functions and execute the code twice against different arguments. 
headphone01 = "sennheiser"
headphone02 = "hifiman"
style01 = "open back headphone"
style02 = "closed back headphone"
def my_headphone(hiFidelity, style):
	print("My favorite headphone is " + hiFidelity + " and it is " + style)
# my_headphone(headpone01, style01) # type this is in global


# Lab 5 List Arguments and For Loops
# For the final example create two lists that are to be passed into your function. Create a function with a for loop
# in it that will execute against all elements in the lists you pass through. Execute the function passing in your list. 
# The output should be the code of your function is executed against each element. 
def my_headphone(hiFidelity):
	for h in hiFidelity:
		print(h) # do not forget to indent this print #
headphones = ['sennheiser', 'hifiman', 'bose', 'audeze']
# my_headphone(headphones) # type this in the global
def music_online(streaming):
	for s in streaming:
		print(s)
services = ['iTunes', 'Tidal', 'Qobuz', 'Spotify']
# music_online(services) # type this in
